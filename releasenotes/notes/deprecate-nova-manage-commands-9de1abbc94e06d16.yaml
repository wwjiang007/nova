deprecations:
  - |
    A number of `nova-manage` commands have been deprecated. The commands,
    along with the reasons for their deprecation, are listed below:

    `shell`

      This starts the Python interactive interpreter. It is a clone of the same
      functionality found in Django's `django-manage` command. This command
      hasn't been actively maintained in a long time and is not tested. It will
      simply be removed.

    These commands will be removed in their entirety during the Queens cycle.
