    The libvirt driver provides port filtering capability. This capability is
    enabled when the following is true:

    - The `nova.virt.libvirt.firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver` firewall driver
      is enabled
    - Security groups are disabled
    - Neutron port filtering is disabled
    - An IPTables-compatible interface is used, e.g. hybrid mode, where the
        VIF is a tap device

    When enabled, libvirt applies IPTables rules that provide MAC, IP, and
    ARP spoofing protection.

    Previously, setting the `allow_same_net_traffic` config option to `True`
    allowed for same network traffic when using these port filters. This was
    the default case and was the only case tested. Setting this to `False`
    disabled same network traffic *when using the libvirt driver port filtering
    functionality only*, however, this was neither tested nor documented.

    Given that there are other better documented and better tested ways to
    approach this, such as through use of neutron's native port filtering or
    security groups, this functionality has been removed.  Users should instead
    rely on one of these alternatives.
