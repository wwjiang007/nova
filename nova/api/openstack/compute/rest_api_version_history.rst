REST API Version History
========================

This documents the changes made to the REST API with every
microversion change. The description for each version should be a
verbose one which has enough information to be suitable for use in
user documentation.

2.1
---

  This is the initial version of the v2.1 API which supports
  microversions. The V2.1 API is from the REST API users's point of
  view exactly the same as v2.0 except with strong input validation.

  A user can specify a header in the API request::

    X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version: <version>

  where ``<version>`` is any valid api version for this API.

  If no version is specified then the API will behave as if a version
  request of v2.1 was requested.

2.2
---

  Added Keypair type.

  A user can request the creation of a certain 'type' of keypair (``ssh`` or ``x509``)
  in the ``os-keypairs`` plugin

  If no keypair type is specified, then the default ``ssh`` type of keypair is
  created.

  Fixes status code for ``os-keypairs`` create method from 200 to 201

  Fixes status code for ``os-keypairs`` delete method from 202 to 204

2.3 (Maximum in Kilo)
---------------------

  Exposed additional attributes in ``os-extended-server-attributes``:
  ``reservation_id``, ``launch_index``, ``ramdisk_id``, ``kernel_id``, ``hostname``,
  ``root_device_name``, ``userdata``.

  Exposed ``delete_on_termination`` for ``volumes_attached`` in ``os-extended-volumes``.

  This change is required for the extraction of EC2 API into a standalone
  service. It exposes necessary properties absent in public nova APIs yet.
  Add info for Standalone EC2 API to cut access to Nova DB.

2.4
---

  Show the ``reserved`` status on a ``FixedIP`` object in the ``os-fixed-ips`` API
  extension. The extension allows one to ``reserve`` and ``unreserve`` a fixed IP
  but the show method does not report the current status.

2.5
---

  Before version 2.5, the command ``nova list --ip6 xxx`` returns all servers
  for non-admins, as the filter option is silently discarded. There is no
  reason to treat ip6 different from ip, though, so we just add this
  option to the allowed list.

2.6
---

  A new API for getting remote console is added::

    POST /servers/<uuid>/remote-consoles
    {
      "remote_console": {
        "protocol": ["vnc"|"rdp"|"serial"|"spice"],
        "type": ["novnc"|"xpvnc"|"rdp-html5"|"spice-html5"|"serial"]
      }
    }

  Example response::

    {
      "remote_console": {
        "protocol": "vnc",
        "type": "novnc",
        "url": "http://example.com:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=XYZ"
      }
    }

  The old APIs 'os-getVNCConsole', 'os-getSPICEConsole', 'os-getSerialConsole'
  and 'os-getRDPConsole' are removed.

2.7
---

  Check the ``is_public`` attribute of a flavor before adding tenant access
  to it. Reject the request with HTTPConflict error.

2.8
---
  Add 'mks' protocol and 'webmks' type for remote consoles.

2.9
---

  Add a new ``locked`` attribute to the detailed view, update,
  and rebuild action. ``locked`` will be ``true`` if anyone is currently holding
  a lock on the server, ``false`` otherwise.

2.10
----

  Added user_id parameter to os-keypairs plugin, as well as a new property
  in the request body, for the create operation.

  Administrators will be able to list, get details and delete keypairs owned by
  users other than themselves and to create new keypairs on behalf of their
  users.

2.11
----

  Exposed attribute ``forced_down`` for ``os-services``.
  Added ability to change the ``forced_down`` attribute by calling an update.

2.12 (Maximum in Liberty)
-------------------------

  Exposes VIF ``net_id`` attribute in ``os-virtual-interfaces``.
  User will be able to get Virtual Interfaces ``net_id`` in Virtual Interfaces
  list and can determine in which network a Virtual Interface is plugged into.

2.13
----

  Add information ``project_id`` and ``user_id`` to ``os-server-groups``
  API response data.

2.14
----

  Remove ``onSharedStorage`` parameter from server's evacuate action. Nova will
  automatically detect if the instance is on shared storage.
  Also adminPass is removed from the response body. The user can get the
  password with the server's os-server-password action.

2.15
----

  From this version of the API users can choose 'soft-affinity' and
  'soft-anti-affinity' rules too for server-groups.

2.16
----

  Exposes new host_status attribute for servers/detail and servers/{server_id}.
  Ability to get nova-compute status when querying servers. By default, this is
  only exposed to cloud administrators.

2.17
----

  Add a new API for triggering crash dump in an instance. Different operation
  systems in instance may need different configurations to trigger crash dump.

2.18
----
  Establishes a set of routes that makes project_id an optional construct in v2.1.

2.19
----
  Allow the user to set and get the server description.
  The user will be able to set the description when creating, rebuilding,
  or updating a server, and get the description as part of the server details.

2.20
----
  From this version of the API user can call detach and attach volumes for
  instances which are in shelved and shelved_offloaded state.

2.21
----

  The ``os-instance-actions`` API now returns information from deleted
  instances.

2.22
----

  A new resource servers:migrations added. A new API to force live migration
  to complete added::

    POST /servers/<uuid>/migrations/<id>/action
    {
      "force_complete": null
    }

2.23
----

  From this version of the API users can get the migration summary list by
  index API or the information of a specific migration by get API.
  And the old top-level resource `/os-migrations` won't be extended anymore.
  Add migration_type for old /os-migrations API, also add ref link to the
  /servers/{uuid}/migrations/{id} for it when the migration is an in-progress
  live-migration.

2.24
----

  A new API call to cancel a running live migration::

    DELETE /servers/<uuid>/migrations/<id>

2.25 (Maximum in Mitaka)
------------------------

  Modify input parameter for ``os-migrateLive``. The block_migration will
  support 'auto' value, and disk_over_commit flag will be removed.

2.26
----

  Added support of server tags.

  A user can create, update, delete or check existence of simple string tags
  for servers by the os-server-tags plugin.

  The resource point for these operations is /servers/<server_id>/tags

  A user can add a single tag to the server by sending PUT request to the
  /servers/<server_id>/tags/<tag>

  where <tag> is any valid tag name.

  A user can replace **all** current server tags to the new set of tags
  by sending PUT request to the /servers/<server_id>/tags. New set of tags
  must be specified in request body. This set must be in list 'tags'.

  A user can remove specified tag from the server by sending DELETE request
  to the /servers/<server_id>/tags/<tag>

  where <tag> is tag name which user wants to remove.

  A user can remove **all** tags from the server by sending DELETE request
  to the /servers/<server_id>/tags

  A user can get a set of server tags with information about server by sending
  GET request to the /servers/<server_id>

  Request returns dictionary with information about specified server, including
  list 'tags' ::

      {
          'id': {server_id},
          ...
          'tags': ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
      }

  A user can get **only** a set of server tags by sending GET request to the
  /servers/<server_id>/tags

  Response ::

      {
         'tags': ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
      }

  A user can check if a tag exists or not on a server by sending
  GET /servers/{server_id}/tags/{tag}

  Request returns `204 No Content` if tag exist on a server or `404 Not Found`
  if tag doesn't exist on a server.

  A user can filter servers in GET /servers request by new filters:

  * tags
  * tags-any
  * not-tags
  * not-tags-any

  These filters can be combined. Also user can use more than one string tags
  for each filter. In this case string tags for each filter must be separated
  by comma: GET /servers?tags=red&tags-any=green,orange

2.27
----

  Added support for the new form of microversion headers described in the
  `Microversion Specification
  <http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-wg/guidelines/microversion_specification.html>`_.
  Both the original form of header and the new form is supported.

2.28
----

  Nova API hypervisor.cpu_info change from string to JSON object.

  From this version of the API the hypervisor's 'cpu_info' field will be
  will returned as JSON object (not string) by sending GET request
  to the /v2.1/os-hypervisors/{hypervisor_id}.

2.29
----

  Updates the POST request body for the ``evacuate`` action to include the
  optional ``force`` boolean field defaulted to False.
  Also changes the evacuate action behaviour when providing a ``host`` string
  field by calling the nova scheduler to verify the provided host unless the
  ``force`` attribute is set.

2.30
----

  Updates the POST request body for the ``live-migrate`` action to include the
  optional ``force`` boolean field defaulted to False.
  Also changes the live-migrate action behaviour when providing a ``host``
  string field by calling the nova scheduler to verify the provided host unless
  the ``force`` attribute is set.

2.31
----

  Fix os-console-auth-tokens to return connection info for all types of tokens,
  not just RDP.

2.32
----

  Adds an optional, arbitrary 'tag' item to the 'networks' item in the server
  boot request body. In addition, every item in the block_device_mapping_v2
  array can also have an optional, arbitrary 'tag' item. These tags are used to
  identify virtual device metadata, as exposed in the metadata API and on the
  config drive. For example, a network interface on the virtual PCI bus tagged
  with 'nic1' will appear in the metadata along with its bus (PCI), bus address
  (ex: 0000:00:02.0), MAC address, and tag ('nic1').

  .. note:: A bug has caused the tag attribute to no longer be accepted for
    networks starting with version 2.37 and for block_device_mapping_v2
    starting with version 2.33. In other words, networks could only be tagged
    between versions 2.32 and 2.36 inclusively and block devices only in
    version 2.32. As of version 2.42 the tag attribute has been restored and
    both networks and block devices can be tagged again.

2.33
----

  Support pagination for hypervisor by accepting limit and marker from the GET
  API request::

    GET /v2.1/{tenant_id}/os-hypervisors?marker={hypervisor_id}&limit={limit}

  In the context of device tagging at server create time, 2.33 also removes the
  tag attribute from block_device_mapping_v2. This is a bug that is fixed in
  2.42, in which the tag attribute is reintroduced.

2.34
----

  Checks in ``os-migrateLive`` before live-migration actually starts are now
  made in background. ``os-migrateLive`` is not throwing `400 Bad Request` if
  pre-live-migration checks fail.

2.35
----

  Added pagination support for keypairs.

  Optional parameters 'limit' and 'marker' were added to GET /os-keypairs
  request, the default sort_key was changed to 'name' field as ASC order,
  the generic request format is::

    GET /os-keypairs?limit={limit}&marker={kp_name}

2.36
----

  All the APIs which proxy to another service were deprecated in this version,
  also the fping API. Those APIs will return 404 with Microversion 2.36. The
  network related quotas and limits are removed from API also. The deprecated
  API endpoints as below::

    '/images'
    '/os-networks'
    '/os-tenant-networks'
    '/os-fixed-ips'
    '/os-floating-ips'
    '/os-floating-ips-bulk'
    '/os-floating-ip-pools'
    '/os-floating-ip-dns'
    '/os-security-groups'
    '/os-security-group-rules'
    '/os-security-group-default-rules'
    '/os-volumes'
    '/os-snapshots'
    '/os-baremetal-nodes'
    '/os-fping'

2.37
----

  Added support for automatic allocation of networking, also known as "Get Me a
  Network". With this microversion, when requesting the creation of a new
  server (or servers) the ``networks`` entry in the ``server`` portion of the
  request body is required. The ``networks`` object in the request can either
  be a list or an enum with values:

  #. *none* which means no networking will be allocated for the created
     server(s).
  #. *auto* which means either a network that is already available to the
     project will be used, or if one does not exist, will be automatically
     created for the project. Automatic network allocation for a project only
     happens once for a project. Subsequent requests using *auto* for the same
     project will reuse the network that was previously allocated.

  Also, the ``uuid`` field in the ``networks`` object in the server create
  request is now strictly enforced to be in UUID format.

  In the context of device tagging at server create time, 2.37 also removes the
  tag attribute from networks. This is a bug that is fixed in 2.42, in which
  the tag attribute is reintroduced.

2.38 (Maximum in Newton)
------------------------

  Before version 2.38, the command ``nova list --status invalid_status`` was
  returning empty list for non admin user and 500 InternalServerError for admin
  user. As there are sufficient statuses defined already, any invalid status
  should not be accepted. From this version of the API admin as well as non
  admin user will get 400 HTTPBadRequest if invalid status is passed to nova
  list command.

2.39
----

  Deprecates image-metadata proxy API that is just a proxy for Glance API
  to operate the image metadata. Also removes the extra quota enforcement with
  Nova `metadata` quota (quota checks for 'createImage' and 'createBackup'
  actions in Nova were removed). After this version Glance configuration
  option `image_property_quota` should be used to control the quota of
  image metadatas. Also, removes the `maxImageMeta` field from `os-limits`
  API response.

2.40
----

  Optional query parameters ``limit`` and ``marker`` were added to the
  ``os-simple-tenant-usage`` endpoints for pagination. If a limit isn’t
  provided, the configurable ``max_limit`` will be used which currently
  defaults to 1000.

  ::

      GET /os-simple-tenant-usage?limit={limit}&marker={instance_uuid}
      GET /os-simple-tenant-usage/{tenant_id}?limit={limit}&marker={instance_uuid}

  A tenant’s usage statistics may span multiple pages when the number of
  instances exceeds limit, and API consumers will need to stitch together
  the aggregate results if they still want totals for all instances in a
  specific time window, grouped by tenant.

  Older versions of the ``os-simple-tenant-usage`` endpoints will not accept
  these new paging query parameters, but they will start to silently limit by
  ``max_limit`` to encourage the adoption of this new microversion, and
  circumvent the existing possibility of DoS-like usage requests when there
  are thousands of instances.

2.41
----

  The 'uuid' attribute of an aggregate is now returned from calls to the
  `/os-aggregates` endpoint. This attribute is auto-generated upon creation of
  an aggregate. The `os-aggregates` API resource endpoint remains an
  administrator-only API.

2.42 (Maximum in Ocata)
-----------------------

  In the context of device tagging at server create time, a bug has caused the
  tag attribute to no longer be accepted for networks starting with version
  2.37 and for block_device_mapping_v2 starting with version 2.33. Microversion
  2.42 restores the tag parameter to both networks and block_device_mapping_v2,
  allowing networks and block devices to be tagged again.

2.43
----

  The ``os-hosts`` API is deprecated as of the 2.43 microversion. Requests
  made with microversion >= 2.43 will result in a 404 error. To list and show
  host details, use the ``os-hypervisors`` API. To enable or disable a
  service, use the ``os-services`` API. There is no replacement for the
  `shutdown`, `startup`, `reboot`, or `maintenance_mode` actions as those are
  system-level operations which should be outside of the control of the
  compute service.

2.44
----

  The following APIs which are considered as proxies of Neutron networking API,
  are deprecated and will result in a 404 error response in new Microversion::

    POST /servers/{server_uuid}/action
    {
        "addFixedIp": {...}
    }

    POST /servers/{server_uuid}/action
    {
        "removeFixedIp": {...}
    }

    POST /servers/{server_uuid}/action
    {
        "addFloatingIp": {...}
    }

    POST /servers/{server_uuid}/action
    {
        "removeFloatingIp": {...}
    }

  Those server actions can be replaced by calling the Neutron API directly.

  The nova-network specific API to query the server's interfaces is
  deprecated::

    GET /servers/{server_uuid}/os-virtual-interfaces

  To query attached neutron interfaces for a specific server, the API
  `GET /servers/{server_uuid}/os-interface` can be used.

2.45
----

  The ``createImage`` and ``createBackup`` server action APIs no longer return
  a ``Location`` header in the response for the snapshot image, they now return
  a json dict in the response body with an ``image_id`` key and uuid value.
