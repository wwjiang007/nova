    API calls to /os-quota-sets/* will now attempt to validate the
    project_id being opperated on with keystone. If the user has
    enough permissions in user, and the keystone project does not
    exist, a 400 will be returned to prevent invalidate quota data
    from being put in the Nova database. This fixes an effective
    silent error where this would be stored even if this was not a
    valid project_id in the system.
